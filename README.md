As an bike owner, I wanted a website that emphasizes the amazing details of bikes and brings a unique take to presenting them. 
In my opinion, websites should work similarly to the real ones by thoughtfully presenting each product instead of displaying dry sheets.

Languages used HTML,CSS,JS,GSAP.

Things learned:
1. GSAP for animation(Home Page revealing). 
2. Hover Effeccts.
3. Improved the skills.
