As an bike owner, I wanted a website that emphasizes the amazing details of bikes and brings a unique take to presenting them. 
In my opinion, websites should work similarly to the real ones by thoughtfully presenting each product instead of displaying dry sheets.

Languages used HTML,CSS,JS,GSAP.

From this I have learned how to use GSAP for animating. I have also used GSAP for Home page revealing.
